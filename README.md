=====

Project Hex is a turn based strategy game with a heavy emphasis on RPG elements of character building. It is being developed in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) with C# as a 2D game.

Getting Started
===============

Once you have obtained the project files, you can very simply launch the Unity editor (currently v5.3.2f1) and open the project folder.

Scenes
------

Scenes are divided into two categories, **Menu** and **Level**, in their respective folders under [Assets/Scenes/](https://github.com/sshookman/ProjectHex/tree/master/Assets/Scenes).

The **Menu** Scenes handle UI menu screens that do not involve actual gameplay elements, such as main menu, options, character selection, character customization, etc.

The **Level** Scenes handle the actual gameplay levels for the game. One level scene is created for each different map type of the game. They each allow enough customization using PCG to allow for a variety of different map variaties.

Scripts
-------

The structure of the code is still a work in progress, and is subject to change. All scripts are located under [Assets/Scripts/](https://github.com/sshookman/ProjectHex/tree/master/Assets/Scripts).
